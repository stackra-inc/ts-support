# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.5.5] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- 🏢 Org rename — migrated from `@stackra` → `@stackra` across package name,
  repository URLs, author field, peer dependencies, README, workflows, and
  source file headers
- 🔧 Updated CI and publish workflows
- 📝 Updated steering and product docs

## [2.5.4] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Corrected org name and banner path in README

## [2.5.3] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Root cause: `banner.png` was missing (404) — Slack rejects image blocks with
  invalid URLs, returning HTTP 400
- Generated and committed `banner.png` from `banner.svg`
- Restored `slackapi/slack-github-action@v2` (reverted curl approach)

## [2.5.2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Use `jq` to build Slack JSON payloads — properly escapes backticks, em dashes,
  and newlines in release notes that caused HTTP 400

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Fixed broken quoting in Slack failure notification step

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Replaced `slackapi/slack-github-action@v2` with `curl` for Slack notifications
  — eliminates Node 20 deprecation warning and fixes silent webhook failures
  under forced Node 24

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- Upgraded `pnpm/action-setup` v4 → v5 (Node 24 native)
- Disabled `no-explicit-any`, `no-this-alias`, `no-empty-object-type`, and
  `no-control-regex` lint rules — unavoidable in a utility library wrapping
  collect.js generics and facades

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- Upgraded GitHub Actions to Node 24 compatible versions
  - `actions/checkout` v4 → v5
  - `actions/setup-node` v4 → v5
  - `actions/upload-artifact` v4 → v6
  - `actions/download-artifact` v4 → v6
